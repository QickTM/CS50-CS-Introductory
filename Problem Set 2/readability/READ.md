In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.<br>

<br>For example, if we wanted to score the word Code, we would note that in general Scrabble rules, the C is worth 3 points, the o is worth 1 point, the d is worth 2 points, and the e is worth 1 point. Summing these, we get that Code is worth 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 points.
